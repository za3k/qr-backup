Restore directions are included in the PDF, and do not require qr-backup. Make sure to test that you can actually read the QR size you select.

# NAME
qr-backup - back up file(s) to a series of QR codes on paper

# SYNOPSIS
**qr-backup** [*OPTIONS*] *FILE* [*FILE*...]\\
**qr-backup** --restore [*OPTIONS*]\\
**qr-backup** --restore [*OPTIONS*] *IMAGE* [*IMAGE*...]

# DESCRIPTION
**qr-backup** converts a binary file to a backup suitable for printing. The backup is a .pdf file containing several barcodes.

**qr-backup --restore** restores a paper backup and outputs the original file. Restore is done using a webcam or scanner.

Restore is possible without **qr-backup**. Restore directions are included in the paper backup.

# OPTIONS
{both_options}

# BACKUP OPTIONS
{backup_options}

# RESTORE OPTIONS
{restore_options}

# EXIT VALUES
**0**
: Success. This includes certain self-test failures which sometimes fail by chance.

**1**
: Invalid command line option

**2**
: File missing or access failed

**3**
: Self-test restore failed

**4**
: Restore failed

**5**
: **convert** subcommand failed

**6**
: **zbarimg** or **zbarcam** subcommand failed

**7**
: **gpg** subcommand failed

# BUGS
Please report any bugs at https://github.com/za3k/qr-backup/issues .

Sometimes scanned images, including the original PDF, cannot be read successfully and the restore self-check fails. This appears to be a bug in **zbar**.

On Debian, Ubuntu and certain other systems, the default system imagemagick policy prevents reading or writing PDFs. Since **qr-backup** depends on both, it will fail. **qr-backup** does its best to report this problem clearly.

It is possible to print barcodes so large or small your webcam or scanner cannot read them. Make sure to test your restore process when using non-default settings.

This backup was generated using qr-backup, a program to back up computer files to physical paper. The person who made the backup went through a lot of work to make and print this document, and will probably be mad at you if you throw it out. They will also end up with big problems if/when their important file goes missing.

== Information about this backup ==

File: {restore_file}
Backup created on: {backup_date}
Size (bytes): {original_len}
SHA256: {sha256sum}
Command used: {nice_cmd}
{notes}
== How to restore ==

You will need access to a Linux computer and a command line. You will also need to install 'zbar' and imagemagick.

To restore using a webcam and the Linux command line:
  Step 1 (scan): zbarcam --raw | tee /tmp/qrs | cut -c1-{code_end}
    Scan each code at least once in any order'
  Step 2 (restore): {howto_restore_cmd} >{restore_file}'
  Step 3 (verify): sha256sum {restore_file} # Check against SHA256 above

To restore using a webcam and qr-backup:
  Step 1: qr-backup --restore

To restore using a scanner and the Linux command line:
  Step 1 (scan): Scan the images with your scanner. Save them as any image format, it doesn't matter.
  Step 2 (scan): zbarimg -q --raw *.png >/tmp/qrs
  Step 3 (restore): {howto_restore_cmd} >{restore_file}
  Step 4 (verify): sha256sum {restore_file} # Check against SHA256 above

To restore using a scanner and qr-backup:
  qr-backup --restore IMAGE1 IMAGE2 ...

== Dear future archivists ==

(You can probably ignore this section)

If you don't have access to the Linux command line, and you don't have access to qr-backup, here is an explanation of how the backup is structured.
You will need a computing device and a great deal of technical expertise to restore this way.

- First, each QR code is scanned. QR is a 2D "bar"code in common use.
  QR is too complex to explain here. It is designed by Denso Wave. Each QR code holds 7 to 2953 bytes as binary data (depends on the settings)
  The error correction level (L/M/Q/H) and version (size, 1-40) are given in "command" under the backup information above.
  Many common devices can scan QR codes, such as 2012-2020 "smart" cell phones.
- Each QR code is labeled--the label matches the data written under the QR code.
  This data only used to label which code is which. It is removed.
- The non-label contents of each QR-code are base64.
  Base64 holds 6 bits per character. The full character set is:
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/
    = is used as padding so the final size is a multiple of 24 bits
  base64 is detailed in RFC 4648 (base16, base32, and base64). The string "ZXhhbXBsZQ==" is decoded as "example".
  The command-line tool base64 or many commonly-available internet tools provide this function.
  It is reasonable to program a tool to decode base64 yourself. Convert from base-64 given above to base-256 (bytes).
- (*) The decoded base64 from every 'N' QR code is appended together in order.
- At the start of the file is the size (as an ascii decimal) after the space. Remove the length and end padding.
- If the --encrypt option is given, the file must be decrypted.
  The details of GPG decryption are too long to include here, but the algorithm used was AES256.
- If the --compress option is given, the file must be gzip-decompressed.
  The details of gzip are too long to include here, see RFC 1951 (DEFLATE).
  Naming a file "XXX.gz" allows it to be decompressed on Windows, Mac/Apple, BSD, Linux, and Unix.
- The file is now assembled.
- The file is checksummed using sha256, which verifies the file is perfectly restored.
  The checksum is detailed in United States NIST standard FIPS PUB 180-2 (SHA2)
  Many standard tools like sha256 perform this checksum.
- The 'P' codes are reed-solomon erasure codes, used to restore missing 'N' codes at step (*)
  To learn about reed-solomon erasure codes, consult a book about erasure coding. Codes are formed using the first byte of each 'N' code, then the second, and so on. If there are more than 177 N codes, they are broken into groups of 177.
  The parameters chosen are 1 < k < n < 255. n-k is likely to be 177 for all blocks except the last. The polynomial is chosen by an underlying library, but will be the same for each k and n. Use brute-force guessing on good data.
